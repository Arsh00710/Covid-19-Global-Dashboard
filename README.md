COVID-19 DATA INSIGHT

This Power BI project delves into COVID-19 data through four main lenses: Global Overview, Country , Monthly Trends, and USA Analysis. Each section equips users with a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's trajectory and impact.

How the COVID-19 Dashboard Came to Be:

1. Data Import:
Commence by importing a reliable COVID-19 dataset into Power BI from a trusted source.

2. Data Refinement:
Utilize Power Query Editor to cleanse the dataset, eliminating duplicates, adjusting data types, and addressing missing values.

3. Relationship Building:
Forge connections between dataset tables to enable meaningful cross-analysis, linking data fields like cases, deaths, recoveries, and geographic regions.

4. Metric Formulation:
Craft calculated measures within Power BI to compute essential metrics and aggregations from COVID-19 data, such as daily case updates, mortality rates, and recovery trends.

5. Dashboard Development:
Construct an interactive dashboard spanning multiple pages, each tailored to distinct COVID-19 facets. Customize visuals, including line charts, bar graphs, and tables, to effectively communicate pandemic insights.
